// Technically, the statement "JavaScript has no classes" is correct.

// Although JavaScript is object-oriented language, it isn't a class-based languageâ€”
//it's a prototype-based language. 
//There are differences between these two approaches, 
//but since it is possible to use JavaScript like a class-based language,
// many people (including myself) often simply refer to the constructor functions as "classes".
